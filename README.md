## inspo of this project
- This is just a rust implementation of my (fleetingNotes)[https://github.com/doomdagadiggiedahdah/fleetingNotes] program.
- Why fix something that's not broken? because it wasn't not broken:
    - autosave would prevent my espanso from accurately being used
    - color was meh
    - no transparency! 
- above are mostly jokes, but the autosave feature was actually a gamebreaker.
    - Also I wanted to try making something in rust

## A great many thanks
